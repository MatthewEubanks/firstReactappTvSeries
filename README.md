This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This was my first app using React. I used the TV API from TV Maze to view TV show information on the application. I was able to use React to begin learning how to use components and properties. Very interesting and nice way to build applications.
